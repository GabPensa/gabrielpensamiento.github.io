My research interests are at the intersection of Socially Responsible and Behavioral Operations topic. So far, I have focused on ethical sourcing and nonprofit operations management.

  * **Abstract**: Companies often rely on third-party social audits to assess suppliers’ social responsibility (SR) practices. However, empirical evidence suggests these audits can often be too lenient and poor practices go unreported, particularly if the auditor feels beholden to the supplier. We design and conduct an incentivized lab experiment to study how a supplier choosing and/or paying the auditor affects audit reports. We explore whether and how these levers affect auditors’ assessment of noisy signals about the supplier’s practices, and investigate the role of two behavioral phenomena: motivated reasoning and reciprocity. We find that auditors who are paid and chosen by the supplier are more lenient, with the effect more pronounced when the information observed suggests poor SR practices. We do not find evidence of auditors being more likely to believe the supplier has good practices when chosen by it. Conversely, reciprocity towards the supplier plays an important role behind our results. Finally, auditors who are merely paid by the supplier are not more lenient, which offers good news for practitioners. Our results can help guide companies’ auditing and procurement policies. First, they show that removing a supplier’s ability to choose its own auditor is critical to increase detection of poor SR practices, particularly when the risk of them is high. Second, removing the suppliers’ ability to choose their auditor—while still paying them—might be enough to reduce leniency. Finally, our findings shed light on some of the behavioral drivers behind auditors decisions, which can guide interventions to mitigate audit leniency. </details>
