* *Academic Collaborators*
  * I'm looking forward to more post-dissertation projects. My methodologiy of choice would be experimental and I'm looking forward to collaborating on projects tied to the social impact or behavioral aspect of business.

* *Industry Collaborators*
  * Iâ€™m am eager to connect with new  industry collaborators, especially those in the greater Pittsburgh community. If you have an interesting problem please send me an email at tic54 (at) katz.pitt.edu to set-up a meeting!
